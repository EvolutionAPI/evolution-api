## Evolution API

This project is based on the [CodeChat](https://github.com/code-chat-br/whatsapp-api). The original project is an implementation of [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys), serving as a Restful API service that controls WhatsApp functions.</br> 
The code allows the creation of multiservice chats, service bots, or any other system that utilizes WhatsApp. The documentation provides instructions on how to set up and use the project, as well as additional information about its features and configuration options.

## Types of Connections

The Evolution API supports multiple types of connections to WhatsApp, allowing for flexible and powerful integration options:

- **WhatsApp API - Baileys**:
  - A free WhatsApp API based on WhatsApp Web, leveraging the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).
  - This connection type allows you to control WhatsApp Web functionalities through a RESTful API, making it suitable for multi-service chats, service bots, or any other systems utilizing WhatsApp.
  - Note: This method relies on the web version of WhatsApp and may have limitations compared to official APIs.

- **WhatsApp Cloud API**:
  - The official WhatsApp API provided by Meta (formerly Facebook).
  - This connection type offers a more robust and reliable solution, designed for businesses needing higher volumes of messaging and better integration support.
  - The Cloud API supports features such as end-to-end encryption, advanced analytics, and more comprehensive customer service tools.
  - To use this API, you must comply with Meta's policies and potentially pay for usage based on message volume and other factors.

## Telemetry Notice

To continuously improve our services, we have implemented telemetry that collects data on the routes used, the most accessed routes, and the version of the API in use.
